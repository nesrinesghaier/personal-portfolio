#### Intro
I am Full Stack Engineer currently working at [Eonics](https://eonics.nl/) where I work 
on designing and developing new extensions for clients in a robotic process automation software called [Nixz](https://nixz.io/).
My primary job functions are as a full stack developer and software engineer.
<br>
I am curious in exploring interesting projects and their build process. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, and physics.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At Eonics I have learned how to work with varied team members, deal with customers needs, and build bots that automates client tasks. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications (see [nixz.io](https://nixz.io/)).

#### Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Teboulba, Monastir, Tunisia. I have since lived in
kasserine, Monastir, Sousse and Tunis.

- I am a person who loves to travel all the corners of the world but not always had the chance to do so.

- In 2018, I visited Egypt as a contestant in [ACM ACPC](http://acpc.global/
+.).

#### Fun facts

- I have a list of crazy ideas that walk around my head by night.
- I recently decided to always have a notebook with me to write down things I forget.
- I lose a lot of my energy in constant overthinking.
- I am good with map directions and places in general (plan B: makes me a good taxi driver xD).
- I am a person who forgets A LOT. So you have to be lucky if I still remember your name after a while. 

#### I dream of

- always improving myself.
- helping people in need.
- handling it together in stressful times.
- no one checking my commit history for early drafts of this file.
